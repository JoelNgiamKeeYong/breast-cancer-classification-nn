# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction App

## 🚀 Business Scenario

Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast mass images. This information can assist medical professionals in making informed decisions about patient care.

## 🧠 Business Problem

Manually analyzing breast mass images and patient data is time-consuming and can be subject to human error. An automated prediction model can help:

- **Provide a rapid and objective assessment** of tumor malignancy.
- **Assist in prioritizing cases** for further investigation.
- **Potentially improve diagnostic accuracy** and reduce delays in treatment.

## 🛠️ Solution Approach

This project uses a Logistic Regression model for breast cancer prediction. The workflow includes:

### 1️⃣ **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

- **Dataset Loading:** The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset was used (e.g., from a CSV file or scikit-learn's datasets).
- **Data Exploration:** The dataset was explored to understand the features and their distributions.
- **Data Cleaning:** Unnecessary columns (e.g., ID columns) were removed. Missing values (if any) would be handled at this stage (though the example dataset doesn't have them).
- **Feature Selection (Optional):** Techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance from tree-based models could be used to select the most relevant features.
- **Data Scaling:** Features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to have zero mean and unit variance. This is essential for Logistic Regression.
- **Train/Test Split:** The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

### 2️⃣ **Model Building and Training**

- **Logistic Regression Model:** A Logistic Regression model was trained on the training data using scikit-learn.
- **Model Compilation (Not applicable for Logistic Regression):** Logistic Regression doesn't require compilation like neural networks.
- **Training:** The model was trained on the training data.

### 3️⃣ **Model Evaluation**

- **Test Set Performance:** The trained model was evaluated on the held-out test set to assess its performance. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix were used as evaluation metrics.
- **Model and Scaler Saving:** The trained model and the fitted `StandardScaler` were saved using `pickle` for later use in the Streamlit application.

### 4️⃣ **Streamlit App Development**

- **User Interface:** A Streamlit app was created to provide an interactive way for users to input patient data and get predictions.
- **Model and Scaler Loading:** The saved model and `StandardScaler` are loaded into the Streamlit app.
- **Prediction:** The app takes user input, preprocesses it (scaling using the loaded `StandardScaler`), and uses the loaded model to predict the tumor's class (malignant/benign).
- **Results Display:** The app displays the prediction (malignant/benign) and the probability of malignancy.

## ⚠️ Limitations

1️⃣ **Dataset Size:** The dataset size might be limited, affecting the model's ability to generalize to a broader population.

2️⃣ **Model Complexity:** Logistic Regression is a relatively simple model. More complex models (e.g., neural networks, random forests) might achieve higher performance but require more data and computational resources.

3️⃣ **Data Quality:** The quality of the input data is crucial. Errors or inconsistencies in the data can affect the model's predictions.
